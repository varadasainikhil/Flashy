# Flashy
This is a Flash Cards App, that helps you learn French words. The app will show you a French word, after 3 seconds it will show the equavalent english word. If you are able to guess the word correctly then you can click the green tick button.
This will remove the word from the list. If you dont remember the word, you can click the red cross button, this will not delete the word. The next time you open the app, the app remembers the words you missed and it will show that words only.
The Screenshot of the app is attached down below -
